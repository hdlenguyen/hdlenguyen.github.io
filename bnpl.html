      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Background</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>Buy Now, Pay Later is a method of paying for online and in-store purchases in installments that’s taken off in popularity in Canada, <a href="https://zip.co/en-ca/blog/canada-lags-behind-in-the-race-to-adopt-buy-now-pay-later-and-that-could-be-your-advantage">growing by 41.1% in 2021</a>. The combination of an interest-free loan with no credit impact is especially popular with younger consumers. During my internship at RBC, I worked with design research interns on the Mobile and I Want a Home journey teams to investigate this emerging alternative form of credit in Canada.</div>
      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Research Question</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>BNPL is an increasingly popular method of payment for online purchases with young people who are <a href='https://thehustle.co/03152022-bnpl/'>more wary of conventional credit</a>. Through a multi-method study that would begin broadly and gradually zoom in, our research question was,<i>Why do people between 18-35 choose to defer online payments using BNPL?</i>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>Our hypothesis was that people chose to use BNPL in order to:
        <ul><li>Take advantage of interest-free payments and</li> 
        <li>Have the instant gratification of purchasing items they may not be able to pay for in full immediately.</li>
        </ul></div>
      <div class="portfolio-heading">Methods</div>
      <div class='portfolio-image'>
        <img src='portfolio/bnpl/bnpl-methods.png'>
      </div>
      <div class="portfolio-body">In order to understand why people choose to defer payments, surveys, an unmoderated experiment, and moderated user interviews were the primary research methods. Across all methods, we recruited Canadians who were 18-35 years old and had either previously used BNPL or were open to BNPL. Including people who had not used BNPL but were open to using it provided more information about why users chose not use BNPL as well as expanding the recruitment pool.</div>
      <div class='portfolio-heading'>My Role</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>In this project, I owned the moderated interviews including the creation of the discussion guide, participant recruitment, interview moderation, research synthesis and presentation. I worked closely with my fellow interns on designing and synthesising both the survey and experiment and were supervised by two senior researchers who provided guidance on research design and project management.</div> 
      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Research Process</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>The project began with a literature review as well as stakeholder interviews with those working on BNPL initiatives at RBC. This shaped the research question and informed what methods we would use to answer this complex question. Surveys provided context for consumer behaviour such as average spend using BNPL and what kind of purchases were made. However, surveys alone could not answer the financial and behavioural context behind these purchases as well as financial literacy about the fine print of BNPL. Therefore, both unmoderated experiments and moderated interviews were used to answer the ‘why’ to the research question.</div> 
      <div class="portfolio-body">Credit literacy was a key aspect to this project - stakeholders often assumed that BNPL users had little credit literacy and did not completely understand what they were getting themselves into. If users understood credit better, they would avoid the ‘risky’ BNPL and likely use safer traditional credit instead. To test these assumptions, an unmoderated experiment was conducted where users were presented with a chart that progressively disclosed more information about the potential credit impacts of different BNPL providers and asked which provider they preferred and why.</div> 
      <div class="portfolio-body">After the surveys and unmoderated experiments, there were many insights as to how people used BNPL and how they understood BNPL from a credit perspective but these still did not answer why people used BNPL. With the context and understanding built from these prior methods, I conducted moderated interviews to understand what factors influenced the decision to use BNPL. The interview design was informed by the <a href="http://www.whencoffeeandkalecompete.com/">JTBD method</a> where the pull, push, inertia, and anxiety factors of users are investigated to understand why they made this decision. Since traditional credit is the default online payment option, using the JTBD method helped me investigate how early adopters of a new payment technology made this change.e</div>
      <div class="portfolio-heading">Key Findings</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>Our research found that people chose to use BNPL in order to:
        <ul><li>Take advantage of interest-free payments <i>without relying on conventional credit,</i></li> 
        <li><i>Flexibility in spreading out large transactions</i></li>
        <li>Have the instant gratification of purchasing items they may not be able to pay for in full immediately.</li>
        </ul></div>
      <div class="portfolio-body">We also identified two types of BNPL users: savvy and spendy. Savvy users typically used BNPL to take advantage of interest-free payments on big purchases like furniture which were planned in advance. Spendy users used BNPL for impulse purchases and used BNPL as an alternative to credit when credit availability was low. Both users had resistance to conventional credit and saw BNPL as a credible and trustworthy alternative.</div>

      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Outcomes</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>The results of this research were presented at a company-wide research jam at RBC and shared with internal stakeholders working in this space to influence future product directions.</div> 
      <div class="portfolio-body">Credit is the common thread that influences consumer behaviour when shopping online, looking for a mortgage, or applying for business loans. This project was not only about understanding consumer attitudes towards BNPL compared to conventional credit but about confronting assumptions about why consumers use BNPL. Some of the assumptions I heard during the initial stages of this project were that BNPL consumers may be fueling irresponsible spending or have poor understandings of conventional credit. Without research, these assumptions would build products and design approaches to credit for young consumers unchallenged. As co-ops, we were proud to present novel and strategic work that pushed the envelope of what interns can do.</div>
