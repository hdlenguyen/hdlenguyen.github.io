       <div class="portfolio-heading">Project Overview</div>
      <div class="portfolio-body">
        <ul><li>Organization: RBC</li>
        <li>Role: Design Research Intern</li>
        <li>Team: Emily Cho, Maggie Chen</li>
        </ul></div>
      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Background</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>During my internship at RBC in 2021, I worked with two fellow design research interns on the Mobile and I Want a Home journey teams to investigate Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), an emerging alternative form of credit in Canada.</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>Our initial challenge was finding a project that was relevant and meaningful across three teams. We shared the common thread of credit but this broad concept required us to use the lens of design strategy to focus and refine our efforts into an innovative problem space. Buy Now, Pay Later was an interesting product to research because it represented an old form of consumer credit that was repackaged for a younger generation with different financial attitudes and habits. These intersections made it a great choice for our research project.</div>
      
      <div class="portfolio-heading">Methods</div>
      <div class="portfolio-body">
        <ul><li>Literature review</li>
        <li>Heuristic evaluation</li>
        <li>Expert interview</li>
        <li>Unmoderated experiment</li>
        <li>Remote moderated interviews</li>
      </ul></div>
      <div class="portfolio-body">In this project, I jointly worked on the literature review, survey, and experiments with my fellow co-ops and independently led and conducted the moderated interviews.</div>
      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Key Findings</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>Our main research question was:</div>  
      <div class='portfolio-body-italic'>Why do people between 18-35 choose to defer online payments using BNPL?</div> 
      <div class='portfolio-body'>Our hypothesis was that people chose to use BNPL in order to:
      <ul><li>Take advantage of interest-free payments and</li> 
      <li>Have the instant gratification of purchasing items they may not be able to pay for in full immediately.</li>
      </ul></div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>Through our research, we found that people choose to defer payments because:</div> 
      <div class="portfolio-body">
      <ul><li>They want to take advantage of interest-free payments without relying on conventional credit,</li> 
      <li>Flexbility in spreading out large transactions,</li> 
      <li>The instant gratification of things they may not be able to pay for in full immediately.</li>
      </ul></div> 
      <div class="portfolio-body">Through our research, we created two personas of the average BNPL user: savvy and spendy.</div>

      <div class='portfolio-heading'>Conclusion</div>
      <div class='portfolio-body'>A major challenge we faced in this project was analyzing the large and varied data from different methods. Thorough qualitative coding and consultation with senior researchers helped us develop meaningful themes that were informative without being overly granular. I found that our unmoderated research helped us to identify areas of interest and moderated research provided us with deeper insight into those areas.</div> 
      <div class="portfolio-body">Through this work, we were able to better understand the appeal of BNPL as well as what young consumers look for in credit alternatives. The results of this research were presented to the design research community at RBC and shared with internal stakeholders working in this space. As co-ops, we were proud to present novel and strategic work that pushed the envelope of what interns can do.</div>
